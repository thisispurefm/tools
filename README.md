# tools

Tools is PureFM's intranet - a place for our members to find all sorts of useful information about the station and our operations!

It's currently being developed, so there might be some strange bugs.

## Technology
Tools is built using PHP, HTML, CSS with a bit of JS. It uses a version of [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/) for frontend styling with lots of custom styles added on top. Hosted on our VPS.
